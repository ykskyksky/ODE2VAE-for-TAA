##Reference paper is [ODE2VAE: Deep generative second order ODEs with Bayesian neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10994)

Proposal:

Project goals:

1. Implement ODE2VAE and test on toy examples

2. Predict returns by asset class (ex. stock index, fixed income, credit spread, REIT, commodities, volatility, etc.)

3. Classify business cycle phases by MCMC or something, and try to enhance prediction accuracy of asset returns
