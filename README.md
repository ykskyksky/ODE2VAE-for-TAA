Reference paper is [ODE2VAE: Deep generative second order ODEs with Bayesian neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10994)

Proposal:

Project goals:

1. Implement ODE2VAE using the author's code and test on the MNIST dataset.

2. Test on financial markets indices (ex. stock index, fixed income, credit spread, REIT, commodities, volatility, etc.) to extract latent space.

3. Compare the variables of the latent space with PCA factors.
